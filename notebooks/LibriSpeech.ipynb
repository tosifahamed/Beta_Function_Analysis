            " method as opposed to the other way around. I don't know how you feel I know which foot up. Yeah, I think that that was also my sort of like I guess at that eyes level. I think what was missing in terms of work, then a kind of shift in emphasis that would maybe be good is to yeah really just make it clear that these will be very useful for something without just saying it's like a new method and I think there's also ties in with like superficially it seems like you know their methods do all of these kinds of things all right right so I think you know you have to just make it clear that this isn't just like a fun like math problem that you want to solve but you know there's already methods for like clustering and neural data you know gene regulatory now or like all of this is like you pretty established faith. So I think yeah this is where if you can lay out like a very sort of specific problem and then really use that to be like you know this this is something that we really can't do rather than saying like oh we don't know how to look at like large scale neural data or something like a little bit more of a focused entry point and yeah I think like Zuck had been saying after you can kind of zoom it out to be like you know the goal isn't just to apply this to you know Gcamp data and neuroscience it can also apply very directly to this this and this I think it would be better if you did that at the level of each of the aims rather than also trying to just at the end say like oh this applies to like everything I think at that point just seems kind of like you know like a BS closing thing being like oh it's more general than what it is but I'm not going to tell you really how any of this applies so yeah I think that that seems like that sort of like the main thing that if you can focus on changing would probably add the most value over specifics did you get that amount of time that this took was it like roughly 15? It seemed around 15 I didn't time it exactly but yeah it was like 32 you stopped and I think we should yeah I think yeah obviously I completely agree I think having some sense of why current methods are insufficient to solve what you're solving I think will also be will be helpful oh to say another thought I feel like you need to be a little bit more structured in your writing okay and and one thought is the um somehow find a way to organize what connects all of these problems yeah the more of a structured way and then lay them out according to that you know like I don't know what it is exactly um I think I need to be clear yeah so I like to think I look all of these problem fall under this general framework or umbrella or input output relations or or something like that I think it'll be a lot easier to follow um as opposed to like here's if the lifts the problems that I'm interested in and here's what I'm going to do about it but no look this is the broader mission of the lab here's what we want to be known for for tackling problems with these sorts of um it shrinks or these kinds of dynamics or you know something that that makes all these things sound a little bit more connected which I'm sure they are in your head it's just not coming across um to me as much yeah I agree with that and I think fine it's sort of like the overall kind of like structuring things um I think you know what's also really important and you mentioned it but you didn't do it is that really unclear whether the short-term goals um for each of these directions is like a very concrete thing that you know you should so so usually uh you know beyond like structuring and so that you know like the short-term goals they're basically what you can write a grant on like tomorrow is also just something where it's like the short-term goals you if like people ask you like what are you going to do on this this and this like you should have like very explicit answers for like you know my first student will do this right on this like problem or something whereas the long-term ones are more like you know things that maybe aren't as like fleshed out but you have like clear directions so I think that also kind of structures things of like what's really fair to drill down on because you are like saying you are going to start that as soon as you're drawing um so can you structure things beyond also like connecting the things I think it would be good to be like you know this is like the short-term like almost like goal and what we want to accomplish followed by like this long term like you know we want to apply it to these other flavors of problems where we think this can generalize and maybe we want to fourth more like uh general frameworks which we think can lead like multiple fields in this right direction or something like if you could say some of these kind of things it also makes it clear that you have like you know just like more concrete plan yeah but I think that was a weakness right now is that if you put forth like a lot of ideas but one yeah they're not and they're not connected like very recently so it just seems like a mish mash of like um things and it's also unclear what are like your real priorities and like what are you like really really like um focused on and into and what are like extensions of that so yeah maybe if you can come up with like yeah I think what's like I was saying like so better way of like connecting and being like this is like the big picture of my lab you kind of did that being like um I don't know you did it in like a couple of different like flavors like being like all we want to um you know like what is like latent in systems or ways of like accounting for like you know maybe slow time scale things or like structure but it wasn't like explicit like I would just come up with one way of like really saying it and then just keep thing that same thing throughout rather than like rewording it into something else which seems maybe um unclear if it's maybe like the same thing or different um and then yeah this kind of structure it is like these are all aims kind of getting at that underlying thing um either in like maybe what you can do is in like different types of data getting at the same underlying thing right like that's one way you can maybe easily like pitch it in a way that's like very interpretable where it's like one is in sort of RNA-Seq in like gene level data or one is like a neural data like that might be how you can pitch it right like we want to focus on these two classes um um you know these two types of data pull out these kinds of you know hidden structure yeah right the first one we're going to tell you about like neural data and this and then for the second or this type of data and then the second it's more like this more discrete gene data or something I got I'm not sure if that's the best way but like if you can do it in a way like that might be also interpretable but to biologists it's like um like this is how you're thinking I have a structure in mind I think one is uh spatial temporal neurons so when you have to take a corn for space uh and the geometry of the problem like in the embryo and the other where these are just some nodes on a graph and you have some dynamics uh and space itself doesn't come into the into the picture so that's kind of how I've been uh I've been thinking of it I tried pitching it once and I think there were a couple of people in the room who were who were kind of like debating that split and then I was like this is not the discussion I want to have so then I kind of like just uh didn't split it that way but I agree that I think yeah uh uh go ahead and structure would would help because these are so different problems uh and many different domains uh so something like that would be would be so I'll yeah go back to the lineboard double down that these are like mutually exclusive categories or something yeah yeah yeah you think it's like for me it was flavored but yeah I think yeah like some I think overall just like some structure yeah that um you kind of like see through yeah then yeah one just have like a short term like this is really the goal and there you can take people through some like details of like you know this is maybe how we want to approach it and like this is an example of the kind of like you know the more technical method we would like to develop that will accomplish x for x problems and then the long term then you can leave that more open ended and say like we think this will you know work really well for example for like you know cancer cells in their dynamics right like we think we can use a very similar class model in the future and I would you know this is where it isn't bad to say that like you know and I be excited to work with people here on this even though I don't have that experience I think that this is like um you know you know a method that will really work well for that right to just make it clear that you've thought about what the department's also you're in and that you're excited by that not that like you know you just want to work on your own thing but you're saying like oh yeah pennepie to other stuff but I'm not gonna work with people on it I can't necessarily say that all other things I was gonna I was gonna mention as well as make a sound as collaborative as possible even if you don't name drop people if you at least do a little bit of research on okay this guy's working on this and maybe I can apply my method to that you know it'd be you know don't like you don't want to sound like you know you're you're poignant or like trying to be like desperate but you know just very brief like mentions of other types of problems that that be that you could collaborate with people in department I think is generally a good thing um and then yeah like so if you shift to like problem method format um along with what I know what you're saying about the fire like shorts are long term just just highlight the outcomes like look at things go well what is you know why are people gonna care what is this gonna do for biology or you know just you know tie it back I think it's it's nice to end a subsection that way as opposed to in some technical point right so just try to focus a little bit on the on the outcomes which you related to the problem that I just solve yeah I guess like it didn't line with that I think when you go through the summary of your previous work um it's also good if you can kind of structure it in that way being like you know this is why I started working on it you know there wasn't like a way to do this you know this is the you know a very short thing of like what you technically did if like you know that especially if you gave a talk on it you don't need to spend like too much time locally on it and more like you know this is what it accomplished for the field um you almost did that for like you know for the C. elegance trajectory work you were like oh now this is how like people are using it um I think if you can even say like something a little more being like you know by you know structuring this these things this way people are able to identify that there are two major states of locomotion have now pulled out the biological like you know neuropeptides involved in this process like if you can give something like that then it really seems like oh if you work together with biology labs your theory and the modeling will then give people something to actually pull out like biology or something like very practical thing from even if you didn't um like do it by yourself okay like so if you can give those examples I think that would be stronger to motivate why the work was significant this may be one maybe one quite like this you're trying to do a lot in 15 minutes yeah and and I'm wondering like is this necessary can you like you know just focus on one or two problems and then at the end say look I this could also be a fight of this this ask me about it afterwards because it just feels like just rocking through this stuff and like I don't think you're going to be able to like really motivate the problem and you know why is this cool what's you know what kind of data are you even going to get and where you're going to get it from and I think like you know and you can't do that for all four of your problems plus all three of your prior works yeah 15 minutes so maybe think about just focusing on one or two of them in a little bit more detail okay I post to China like Kramidol and yeah yeah I can definitely I think remove two of them it choose the right seems like the right number yeah I mean I had structured them on on short term long term I think so the so first for short long short long and then I think the longer ones I can just be very brief with them this is also a problem that's important now and I'm thinking about people want to hear more though like they have the hour to ask you right it's better that you give them a lot of detailed on one or two problems and it's easier to ask questions about that and then maybe the conversation will just naturally these other problems but like right now the questions I would ask you are a lot more basic questions and not interesting questions and I think it's good to be at a place where you're getting more interesting questions as opposed to well I didn't understand it you know can you just explain this part to me or you know yeah like I know you're saying why can't you just PCA this thing or you know it's up like that yeah I think that this is where also that I think if you just use like you know like structured writing like what you're putting in the truck like set out with saying then it also and if you maintain like the same structure for you to the aims or something and you say like short term this is the thing or whatever and you write it right like we do this in the long term you can you know just say the thing briefly and you write it then it's up there for people to a reference and then comment on even if you know you didn't spend much time so I think if you use the writing also and what put down is a way to really just be an outline of that then I think it's also you know very fair game to just focus on a couple of parts and go in depth and be like you can ask me about this but just have something there so people don't forget that you're not that you are like you know thinking about these other problems and I would say that like you know in terms of like this whole prioritization thing like for the previous work you know you have like a separate presentation on it people might not go to it so it's good to like summarize it and you know they might have your package but they might not read it but it wouldn't spend too like if you're going to cut stuff from I would cut more from from like maybe the previous work or keep that higher level or just really on that especially if you had a chance to really talk about these things rather than cutting some of the future stuff and for the previous work especially if you can't get it to really tie to your future directions or something like that then it's also just kind of like I did some stuff but it's not necessarily relevant so if you can't find like a good way to bridge it like less valuable I think especially since they see that you've published stuff and done stuff already yeah because a lot of this will just be prioritizing your time so you can just sit for like the right things in depth maybe yeah it's there um also um do they expect things like um you know sometimes they want you to go into like what kind of lab you're gonna run the size of your lab and you know are you bench or you doing all through like is it necessary to go to me or that stuff for this or I think at this stage I was told I don't have to but at the next stage then they expect me to think about this a bit after an offer's main stage or so I think right now this is departmental and then if it goes if the department people agree on me then they send it up to the director of the institute and so there then other negotiations happen like start up and then what would yeah yeah so they didn't provide any other like details besides just like a 15-minute truck talk yeah yeah okay 15 yeah and then question not so yeah I think those are more my like high-level things I think we can go into like questions maybe in the circle back if yeah I mean if you have anything it'll it's it'll yeah I'll be useful to see like what's coming across uh based on what you mentioned like uh in what's in art yeah okay so then we could just start with like real some real questions and stuff um yeah so I mean I can start on this and this is kind of what I was asking um you know um you know it's unclear to me at least yeah where where the novelty or like the need for some of these methods are specifically for example and you know the neural data that you talked about there are many methods to cluster dynamics even from like the lab that you've worked with right the Carson work go how is this different from things like raster map and stuff that also I think seem to cluster things based off of their dynamics right right um yeah so that's a good good question um and so the first thing is I think that is a visualization method um so first all yeah so dynamics broadly there's a um so compared to methods that exist broadly for dynamic for kind of dimensional data action or clustering um dynamics is like a very very small part um instead of only a handful um some of them are um very complicated like you have to train and they can't they're not just practical on a hundred thousand or a million year on data set um and then um some of them so raster map would be like a visualization um got them where you uh you don't really get out components it it it it's sorts them and then you can you still have needed to investigate with that goes in and looks at them so what I am looking for or what I am proposing is a scalable method that just um blind you um you know push a button and you get out the most uh dynamical uh components and they way they're interpretable in a very direct way uh um so if you know nothing about the data they you get the lock you get the time scales so you know what are the processes that are happening at the different time scales and you know the neurons that um are responsible for them yeah and that right now does not exist um and I feel like a very real need for it because what happens is that in these um not real recordings for example even when you have a stimulus on um on the on the screen um a lot of the neurons just don't care about the stimulus um they are involved in very various other processes that are happening in the brain only a small uh section often do so you really need to separate the uh this the new activity into the different time scales that are happening uh different processes times because they're happening and then extract the ones that are meaningful to you as an experimenter um and then it and this is um time scales are important it spools it out so the the the assumptions just comes in later the algorithm will will give you what are the dominant time scales at which you can predict the future of dynamics um and then you come in and say oh that looks like attention will that that uh I don't care about that that looks like a stimulus related thing um yeah so senan bias way to get out like all the important processes that are happening in the brain important in the sense of dynamics um and then you can go in and choose to study it all of them or just focus on on a subset yeah so it's kind of like pca but in pca what you do is that the measure is met is variance right uh and what I'm talking about like variance is not a uh biological or a physical concept and sometimes it can be but most of the name it's a statistical quantity whereas what I'm looking for is uh is a time scale that uh or um or predictability of the dynamics and these are much closely related to the underlying processes that are happening and that's what this tries to extract so it's sought by predictability because I have to run and grab my daughter daycare um but I actually don't I don't have too many interesting questions I think most of my comments were just about the things about the talk but um there are a couple small things and I will email them to you thanks thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you sorry sorry I held the wrong button no so um this is on Thursday this is on Thursday time on Thursday um early in the morning for me yeah so exxam this is okay okay let me know how it goes yeah thanks see you thanks a lot yeah see you a second bye yeah I don't know if you know that no I have some time um uh so I'm just a psych I mean we could do the mock questions I don't think you'll be too bad at the questions up in terms of okay I think what you'll be good at is answering the questions technically but I think you won't I'm necessarily do as well on and to it like very naturally is like just tying the like you know the questions are waiting hi to some other like more relevant bullshit that they would care about right so I think like um the technical answer is important right um that will come very naturally to you to be like oh this is how it's you know it's super in and come pull out like time scales and stuff um I think these questions are like ways to pee up you talking about like other things so for example um so you can say like okay so you know this is something that we know is like very relevant to like neuroscience because we know that there are like all these things happening and we've been looking for these kinds of interacting time scales like it rises to sort of the complex dynamics and behavior right um I think that this is where you can you know if you have some thoughts or ideas be like um you know oh what I think would be like for example really cool is if um we can for example tie this to uh you know if we can apply the same sort of thinking to other types of data such as like you know if we um look at like how cells are moving for example in like a tissue or something like that like you know in cancer there's a lot of this like you know cell locality thing we've even looked at some nonlinear dynamic papers on these kinds of things and say like oh you know there are these kinds of things and there it's unclear if there's also multiple time scales type of movement that's you know occur there's something like that right and you know by using these kinds of methods or whatever we can also hopefully um take large amounts of like single cell like tracking data in a similar sort of way but this time it applies this kind of thinking to their like velocity and step to pull out like okay is there some of you know like the are there like these time scales to it and do they derive from like underlying features of like genic breathin or interactions so again I'm not saying that that was you know biologically accurate or whatever to the methods that you're saying but if you could use these opportunities to be like you know I think it'll be good for this is this really sound like technical stuff I'm excited to try one of these other things that could be like cool but say like you know I'm not you know you can be like very out right being like you know I'm not an expert in this kind of stuff and I haven't worked in this but I've like seen papers and stuff that have been trying to employ this kind of thinking to the like this kind of data as well and be like I think this is a great way to maybe move um these like more mature things in neuroscience yeah yeah through these other fields um with like slightly just you know slight alterations not would be like a thing that I'd be very excited to try to do collaboratively in like the future yeah it's correct so right like if you can use your questions as a way to like just very explicitly show like answer and like there's another sort of like practical thing that's very relevant to the department and like a very like a deliverable that seems not like a new method but like uh we do know we can do this and then from that we can pull out key um like the more that you can do that I think the more grounded it'll become for more people there that like what you're doing is something that's like actionable and useful yeah yeah I see yeah thanks I think that's that's a nice video like basically provide the technical answer and then also then talk about just the how aptical it may be to them or something that they make out of our yeah so I think the right way to sometimes prepare for these kinds of things is like um I think there's uh so I think there's like three overall components and I kind of make comments on what I think you'll be like very good at and what you'll need to work on I think one is like just a very technical knowledge right I think they're your fun right the people want to press you on sort of the technical aspect of what you're doing I think you're you know fine you don't need to really practice or think about that much that will be natural um the second is like the whole sort of like delivery of um everything to make it clear that you know you're um mentally organized you have like ideas and like focus and maturity right um that I think what like some work from some of these suggestions and stuff I think that that should be um like you know fine um the third is kind of like um things like um there are things that the department wants to hear and things like you know and I think this is what's okay I was getting into like you know what are you doing that's actually going to be practically useful that they can be like you know that this is why what he'll do is like work it um other things will be like always you willing to like work with biology labs on the questions they care about because they're not hiring you purely for you they're hiring you because you would add to their like department so all these like kind of soft things of like um what beyond his work are we going to right like that what's like bigger picture what's like for the department what is like the these like exciting additional things that he might have besides like technical skills and ability to run a lab that I think is where you need to put some thought into and I think there it's like you need to connect you could put some of those into the presentation with the time you have right thing you know putting the explicit like long-term goals and stuff like this is the deliverable this is why it's exciting the rest I think if you mentally have it like kind of prepared being like oh this is a great talking point for a pencil right like you know I've read this paper and stuff on you know movement of like cancer cells or whatever and you know if you have like that thing you don't need to include it in your presentation as soon as there's a relevant question you kind of answer it like technically and like directly and then you can use that as a way to pivot into saying this other thing um that will be like a very exciting thing to say um without having to have put it into your presentation or waiting for the exact question where someone's like oh tosa tell us about how this relates to like cancer cells right so if you have some of these like mental things like ready then I think you should be like ready to quickly tack them on is like you they'll feel kind of like a whole city sort of interviewee kind of things but I think that that will really get augment like how um engaging like the Q&A will be and show that like you know you are someone that's really thinking about like you know biology that clickability of this biology biology very broadly right not like an arrow I worked on these three things and only wanted but I I think that that if you can just mentally prepare yourself with that right and some points that you want to try to forcibly almost bring up then I think you'll be able to and that will also kind of stimulate further conversation during the Q&A and hopefully drive that towards being like oh people are really excited because you said stuff that they care about yeah thanks yeah oh I think yeah those are three points to the three when it's that you mentioned yeah yeah so I've been doing a little bit of reading and I think I can say there's a thing that sticks out essentially and I can so I can definitely can read that and have those ready yeah any other point and I wanted to help with something too but yeah I don't want like if you have any other feedback or not I have time to afford there okay okay um so yeah I think basically what yeah my problem really is I don't know how to talk with our tests so even when I'm not more the question I think I jump into the details um so I will get your thoughts on um how to like what do I need to do to make this let's say I'm talking about this problem um right which is the um the first thing or amongst the first things I will do yeah yeah exactly yeah so non-statially dynamics I mean I shouldn't really call it a neuroscience problem I think yeah that's where I'm having I think that's where the structure will be needed but basically the problem is this that what do you do when you're when you want to model the dynamics but the underlying dynamical system has it's changing so learning attention um you know in I think you can write that out right so be like you know and I think that in many ways like also with the kept saying that um the sort of structure of like how to even present your things right so what you can have is like your first like you're and you should you know minor point but say somewhat also structured and how you label things like don't use one and one sorry that point so like you you know you have you can say like I have two major directions for example and you can call that one and two and then within that you have like yeah 1.1 or a bc right so some things that just so clarity is very high right so you can say like you know the area the first research area that I like really care about is how do you model systems that have parameters that are like changing constantly over time right and then you can say like you know very um I think in a very sort of um blaming way right like um you know most of the time when we're trying to model systems right um we assume that the system's like at a steady state or so or like you know it is you know constant and we model for that but we know in biology things are a lot more complex the stems are constantly changing you know over time for reasons that we don't you know understand and that's a lot of the richness and biology right so it's not bad to spend like you know a minute just really kind of making it clear that um what you're after is like a core feature in that's relevant in biology right like the richness of biology comes from these kinds of changes and stuff right but in a very true sense not don't focus too much on like parameters changing things like that but you know it seems like oh the system operates uh and like many different states or things like that like you know something where it's like very intuitive to grasp right um and you can say for example like one area where this is like I'm very well appreciated is a neural dynamics right and then you can segue to be like oh you know in when you know this is very obvious in neural dynamics we because methods have allowed us to like you know measure the activity of thousands of neurons with seconds resolution while we measure things like behavior and stuff so we can see how that pivity of the cells within the brain relates to that and here we see clear sort of when we look at like you know behavior and the dynamics we see these clear sorts of things where um you know there are these like almost like state transitions or something and like that activity as well as the behavior and you know the goal of what I want to like accomplish is when we have this kind of data how do we actually decompose that into much more interpretable interacting pieces of dynamics or something they're like one way that I think we can do that is like this and then you can go into like your technical thing of being like if we can break down these you know what are called like non stationary you know dynamical systems via like um stationary subspace analysis we can try to decompose these into parts and with these parts then have a handle into what um these parts correspond to in terms of the biology that we're interested in such as behavior and the case of neuroscience right so it's if you can like do it like that where it's like really like you know more high level question you know your question is like how do we model or how do we analyze systems that are changing over time like it could be something just simple and intuitive like that um and then you know your sub aim would be like um you know it doesn't you have to say like neuroscience you can just keep on saying that this is but like neural data and you can give your apples like uh yeah I think that's what I need to do sorry yeah the question and say like oh you know methods for like um non stationary dynamics and stationary subspace analysis as a thing you can walk people through as an example for neuroscience and be like that is my short term goal is to apply this neural data that I'm very familiar with because I feel like this would really open up a lot of like avenues to then actually explore the mechanisms causing these uh different sort of patterns or whatever right um and then say in the long term right so you can if not that have like very sort of repetitive parallel structure right so always be like your short term I want to accomplish this this specific problem long term for this aim whatever they like to do is think about how we can apply this to other systems that have similar complexity right one such case that I've been thinking about that's really I'm relevant to the department is like you know it with cancer cells in their movement or you know something yeah right like you can come up with that um doesn't even have to be related to exactly what they work on but you know some other thing that you feel confident that you can talk about because you're you've like thought about it right then and then give these things I think you know you just want to say like this method will do this and then when we pull these things out you know the we can then you know use that as a way as a as like a handle into the biology pull out like something concrete like the circuit's responsible for like these state changes something like that and it's fine to be a little bit not like bullshit but it's fine to be like a little bit um you know birthday things but you just want to be simple and how you state them okay so it's fine if it's like a little bit too simple to be like you know we think that this will pull out like the circuit's responsible for X right yeah it's a it's a bit of an overstatement and it's a little over simplified because that's not what will happen yeah but you can make an argument for that so if someone pushed on that you can be like you know once we identify that we can look for the signatures and what you know neurons are connected you know what those neurons are yeah yeah I just what do you about maybe maybe we're not necessarily worried about coming across as naive um but as long as I guess I prefaced this maybe it's okay like to say like I'm not an expert I have the methods aspect down but you know I think this can happen and with the help of people in the department I'm sure we can make it much more concrete something like that I guess yeah exactly so I think as long as you're like soft in the sense that like um but and you can make it clear and it should be clear to them that like you're here to provide methods that will solve biological problems but you're not here to come up with the biological problems or to solve them in the very end right so you know and you can even highlight this and so actually one thing that maybe would be a good thing to get across in your initial thing of like your previous work is this idea that you know you um you know the environments that you've been in that you think were like um to highlight that one of the reasons that you you've had like such a great time in your previous experiences is that oftentimes as you worked very closely with labs um have a lot of like you know wet lab technical expertise um that an appreciation for the need for new methods and step to analyze more and more complex um and larger data and that this is allowed for like sort of a closed loop interaction too right where you know you can get data you you can work with the labs to generate data you help at the method that really fit for that kind of data and problem and you've been able to then use that for analysis and then give it back to the labs for them to look for like you know um we're related biological mechanisms and this is formed like a really good and effective loop for theory and um biology we do I think it's true and right that's absolutely that want to picture yourself anyway right there so I think you want to kind of say that like um sort of I think it was a intro to this whole thing to kind of go by that format right say like this is the closed loop that I've created and this is how the methods that I've produced really aided in our understanding of biology in um in in some cases like you weren't doing the biology right you were playing an integral part in that yeah and then even tee up your own future work to be like you know um and this is like what this is what I want to continue doing right I want to still to have this kind of interaction where I can very readily interact with labs here um to help develop methods that will aid in their data but I also have like directions that I think are really sort of um areas that I've recognized are like um places that really can benefit from these kinds of things that I'll start working on but I think they're much more general than the initial case that I'll provide examples for and I hope that we can spend some time to discuss how we can even generalize the problems of interest amongst people in the department right so I think if you can tee things up like that then I think it just makes it also clear that um well I think it just covers one of your weaknesses which is um like uh you have heard about weaknesses for a department like this where is it you care about the methods yeah right and that is what you're good at at in and of itself isn't a deliverable on its own right but I think if you can make it seem like oh if labs can work with you and you will provide this to the labs very directly then it seems like oh this is great right this is someone that's willing to work on the problems we're interested in to do the kind of work that we can't do which is these kinds of more complex theory modeling and stuff um and I think that that is accurate for you right like you're interested in working on interesting yeah I mean yeah you don't care about the data or the specific problem in many cases as long as it's important it's somewhat interesting and important right man I mean I think yeah I do I do like yeah I do get invested in the problem I feel like much more than uh people like me uh I mean that I know so so then if that's coming across then maybe I'm not like I'm actually yeah I'm not doing a good job of representing the fact that um these problems are not like random problems these are problems that I find exciting inherently yeah and and friends random problems there's different between working on random problem for no reason yeah doing on seemingly random problems you're excited by that yeah and then working on like a very sort of core focused area of research right um I think that um it's clear that you're not working on like random problems for random reasons right like you're interested in that you put a lot of thought that the issue is that you can't it's very hard to make an argument to a non-math of physics department that the the span of what you're working on doesn't um you you did like in the space of like you're you it's very hard to connect all of these areas of research biologically right so I think that it's not that it's random that you're spread across multiple like fields and broad question areas right from like neuroscience to morphogenesis like completely unrelated in regards to like um the fields and selves so I think what you want to highlight is that these have come about also partly because of interactions that you have with lab if you'd write that's really the sort of strength what you're doing and that you're like over arching things like pulling out these late like and I think this is where you can have like also what's a cat was like you know highlight if you can have an overarching like uh like a core concept like you know my like you know what I'm interested in are methods to pull out like latent dynamics from systems specifically at the level of like different time skills like like something like that being like you know like my core research area interest is that and I'm going to tell you how I want to do this in sort of different flavors across two different problems and very two very different areas of biology so if you have that then at least you as a person in sort of methods space are very sort of grounded in like your focus right you have like the same way that like you know neuroscientists work on like you know neurons right but for you it's like it's a singular space you just happen to you know you apply this to multiple systems so then I think it fine and then I think you actually have a great um you can be energetic and that like you're just willing to work with um you know people right like you're not just tied to like I only want to work on the calcium they know right yeah I think before I had this kind of structures you dynamics in biology of biological systems from data directly I mean this does you mean have to be there yeah and then basically um um space space your temporal and I guess no space and there are ways different ways to say this or just like graph network structured which these are two flavors of biological processes that um and examples that I will focus on but um I think the methods and the process are much more general I need all data and data from developing in place and then cross-totter long term um you want to each I guess that or yeah I think something like this is just um you know it's just that full structure right and I think that's what's kind of missing from your current talk is that beyond just like you know it just feels like you have um paragraphs yeah yeah and the paragraph aren't like we need to know structure above like the paragraph okay I'll to make this like oh this is like a you know a chapter in like the whole story right it seems like you have a random paragraph where it's like it's clear oh this is a section this is a section but it's like the nesting and the whole structure of all of it it's not with something like this at least then it becomes very explicit that there is like um you know a high level sort of idea and then there's two core areas in the lab within that there are these specific sort of um data types that fit that and examples that you're going to show and then like applicability to other systems is something that's very easy for people to digest where it seems like okay here's someone that is like mentally organized enough to run a lab uh working on randomists mm-hmm yeah I had it before like this and then through some feedbacks I kind of like reorganized but I like it this way too uh it's just that I don't want to get into debates of like why this structure is this the only possible is played and so on so uh that's guess I think you can again soften these things right right you can't think is that I don't know if you make this clear yeah I can just yeah two flavors flavor one flavor two thing yeah just highlight from the smart that you know because aren't just mutually exclusive right right that makers and you hope that like you know the development to nature of these areas will eventually also aid the other right right because um and and say because there are problems in both of these uh you have problems that you'll talk from or areas of research that you'll talk about later were um you know they might or might not include like you know space or whatever right like neural data also has very spatial topography yeah there's people ignored well ignored or this doesn't present in mouse data right but in like c-elegant like you know the ebrophish things like that they're very like baked in right like uh act don't stop so yeah I think it's like fine to have this but I think at least it shows that you have like some sort of mental organization yeah yeah so I think if you have yeah something just like this where it's like two major areas you know and what you can do is just have like you know split this error and say like you know area one which focuses on these flavor problems and area two which focus is on this right and then when you start talking you can say like you know probably you know for one um you don't need to have it like half split um at that point right like you can have number so you can have um um where you say network and space you can have like um a one and a two right to denote that this matches up later with one and two very very like you don't it's sometimes hard to write when you have this like half lip-pink so then um okay so one and two and then basically one point one you know so you can have one I would write like one there yeah um and then you can you know formulate that is either like the the name for that section or even something along the lines like the question of that section how do we pull out like x from x yeah that like that can even be it and then underneath that you can have your solution which is um you know uh methods for non-stationary data right so for number one you can say you you can have like a question mm-hmm well I would just have it actually and so um I would have its structure sort of uh uh so like erase all the x rural data x all of that well because I think this is um much harder to write um and then um um basically underneath just have one and then have the question then you can just you know go into aim one and just have the short and long for that um and then I'll need that okay okay you're to write and so basically work and then question have like a yeah you don't even have yeah can have network there yeah you have like question and then you can under that question then have your answer which is like a singular sort of thing where it's like methods for non-stationary um dynamical systems yeah yeah right and then this is one the other problem I don't have to go to go into it right like it is so yeah I would have like the first one is like a question solution I you can go into some decent detail about like the subs um subspace analysis and stuff like briefly and say like what this will pull out and how like apply this to neural data will pull out this right right yeah subspace and then I'm going to talk about how this applies to neural data which I think is a great sort of um class of data that has this underlying problem and now you know give you some examples from even my own work where this has been a problem and it's something that I think can really um be important to address then you just need to end that though after you explain your subspace dynamics and stuff being like you know by doing this and by identifying that there's two major you know for example identifying that you know there are these like three major time scales these are the neurons that um are relevant in those time scales we can start to ask are there specific cell types you know it can be like oh we'll check it yeah right like it's cell types is this topographically um uh be you know if you don't want to go into like space because then I might get confusing but like no are there some specific properties of these neurons and that might tell us about you know their molecular identities things like that we can now use this as a handle to identify these specific um clusters of neurons and then you can have a long term and then long term would be like you know um neural data is great for this but or like you know you could say like long term we want it um within neural data you can say like you know whatever your second thing is okay yeah right uh modules or something what do you know? modules um and we think that you know this will directly tie into that and will be a more like general generalized form of that um and then say what's maybe most exciting though is that by formalizing this in neural data we think that we can apply this to um we would be really excited to try to apply this outside neuroscience um and some areas that I've in mind are like this this this and it would be great to actually talk to more people about these kinds of problems because I think these methods should um again yeah generalize well right now well I think if you can structure it like that that's fine um and then you know uh for the second one I would do the same thing right so something like that at least has like certain inherent structure and it's clear that you have um sort of like focus and goals yeah yeah here I think you're trying to pull out like yeah you know not that experience I mean this is this is like a straightforward follow-up actually this is a problem that I would work on now if I had the time um so this is nothing like technically new here I mean there's some challenges but they're not like you know not something that hasn't been done in the past uh I can really pull tools from the library of tools that exists um but yeah for the problem domain by thinking of dynamics in certain products in CLL Castelo and this is new you to again start by saying like you know the question is like oh we know that there are dynamics that exist across space right um and this is like um and you you can even say this is like I'm very much appreciated and actually um really important in processes such as development uh right um so again like keep it more general than what you are doing which is CL against development yeah yeah and thing like you know these are appreciated things over development and have been like you know core drivers and had to think about things such as um uh body patterning more for genesis whatever right um and then you can point out the specific problems um under that which is like um however like one thing that's been really difficult to do right is like do this right like not to serve like question level thing of like how how do you identify which molecular players for example from uh like gene expression data give rise to these patterns so you can set up the intro to it accordingly so you can be like oh you know the dynamics of pattern um are like I've been appreciated as being important features of um development from you know uh body pattern uh body patterning to like more for genesis right um and you you can say in many of these cases we know that up there have been like really good examples of specific genes that give rise to some of these patterns and um you know for example for blend uh generation but you like you give an example of like a classic known thing right yeah yeah yeah contested with being like however we don't have like more diagnostic or unbiased methods or something co-out uh one like uh other candidates that we don't know or ones where it's actually not a single gene but a network of genes or something right like like something not very much is like the question you're formulating basically a question to the answer that you have so just formulate it that way and go into the little you know um specifically like I've been working on this class of like um solutions which allows us to pull out uh you know gene regulatory networks from this kind of data when we have um you know the uh gene expression of cells in uh uh space of a developing system in this case CO against yeah right and then you can talk through the technicalities and then you can say this will allow us to then infer which are the major players driving the formation of these networks in time in space and time and then that will directly allow us to identify which nodes to perturb uh um we'll give us models for like which nodes to perturb that could potentially um break down this kind of patterning and this will allow us to then quickly test the best candidates from these kinds of complex data right here very little at this uh no I think it's just mostly uh oh that is definitely true um yeah no good um not so very nice actually the feedback uh very useful so I think if you do it like that it'll be really good and it'll be like oh you know because if what what post-it method does is like very relevant for a public out of gene regulatory networks in all problems right not like see elegant the valor or like spatial I think the spatial yeah yeah spatial I should really say it as like spatial patterning networks because that's the new thing here uh yeah spatial matterning networks and to pull out the gene regulatory networks involved yeah spatial patterning networks don't mean anything right right like if they're an abstract concept yeah you're regulatory networks to like people working with biology are a very concrete thing so what you want to do is hide the more abstract mathematical thing that you're working on here to concrete biological thing that will come out so then people are like oh what he's doing is pulling out gene regulatory networks for this complex spatial pattern um um happens in development right and again giving that example of like by doing that we were able to then start testing it you know and then we've been starting to do this in ceiligons and these methods are now pulling out like hand-to-it networks and specifically the core genes in that network to then prepare so we can ask if these um like uh genes that have been really been looked at are actually important for this specific um spatial temporal patterning um of you know um the cells in you know ceiligons develop yeah yeah so yeah if you've just phrased it kind of like that then it becomes really clear what your method gives as a handle and for the biological that's your agent and then that should be easy to be like but this is like applicable to any biological question that um where basically we have gene expression data like this is directly applicable to for example any question where we have gene expression data spatially over cut right we can start do this and start you know formulate like interaction networks that are important for um giving rise to the emergent like structure of things right and that is like a very direct lead-in to and you know this is I'm excited because this might be like a really good framework for looking at how cancer develops and how tumors develop and interact in space and time as they progress right it's a very similar problem there because tumors also grow yeah yeah and if you could figure out this kind of interaction network and sort of the spatial um in the spatial temporal like gene regulatory network interactions between normal cells and cancer cells like it rises to this that might be sort of a key thing to really pull out that's more about my level process than just what the cancer cells do yeah yeah I think that that is true I do feel I think a lot of these that I believe in like a lot of these things um a lot of these questions are relevant for much broader processes I mean the whole development program is reactivated many times but do do things like getting tissues together getting cells together moving them around um whether it's in let's say um you know won't the language generation cancer fagiacs that um so I think it's a very similar process that at least like mathematically similar descriptions of it um and then we can use that to to to get it so you have to walk people through yeah just kind of assume that they'll make these strong connections themselves and then the weakest thing would the worst thing would be that like you know you give this great sort of thing talking about see elegance development it seems very obviously connected to yeah like wound healing and regeneration um as well as like you know panther cell progression and tumor progression but they don't you know people don't actually make the connection and they're like it's not clear what to see like you know what I would work with him on or something or why he fits in our department because this seems like a very basic biology and development that right so I think that that would be the saddest thing because it's said like you don't need to bullshit hard like you don't need to bullshit this actually connected it is very connected yeah yeah yeah it's not like even that you're stretching it to be like oh actually like you know this should be maybe relevant uh normal dead it's very connected right the like dinner some of these pathways like even wind was first discovered in cancer yeah no development and um you know cancer very like canton hand same genes for like you know growth uh as it is for like um tumor progression all of this but I think we just can't assume that people get connected you want to drive people to be like in that mindset making that connection and make it clear that you were thinking at that level not at the level of like I care about my mathematical methods for developmental biology right that like you already thought about that and if you kind of tee it up with like the initial part where you say like you want to work hand in hand with labs that are more focused on biology to buy these methods um and develop new ones within these these broad spaces then I think it's really clear that like oh you know you're you're already thinking about it and you understand biology well enough to interface like this right like you don't need to be told like this is a question in the space right um but also that like um you're willing to do it yeah right you're not going to work on C. elegans development yeah no that that's true yeah um it's true next so yeah yeah so you have to you have some time sorry I can keep you yeah it's first okay cool um yeah and the the second name basically I think um you can so this is going to be almost immediately short term um the question is how do we actually do the two regularly networks and rely pattern omensia dynamics right um this yeah I think I should probably work on this a little bit on the phrasing because right now this feels very developmentally um I can make it a bit more formation dynamics is fine and then I think this is where you can also stuff in these things where you know well maybe the most prominent thing for like pattern formation has been in development this is also true um in many systems such as like you know how rumors uh develop or how wounds uh yeah how like wound healing is organized right just say you just say these things to make it like very sort of you know generalize the bowl very obviously and then say this specific example that I'm going to talk about is again in you know development and then this case the work that I've been doing in Seattle again yeah that's it yeah I think I think it's just like basically a pattern after the question to make it a bit more gentle maybe like that specific you're having the questions already general right how do you have change regulatory networks underlying pattern formation that is um yeah it's just how you interpret pattern formation right right so yeah short term in the sense that immediate follow-up basically um and then the deliverable the deliverable is um yeah general aside for um or framework maybe even I don't know for the general method for um so in your first thing when you talk about the immediate like follow-up you want to present it such as um uh like you want to talk about the deliverable there right so I mean you want to take people through the example we have this data where we have um you know i'm a pre-expert in data across time in lecy elegans and from that I've been working on methods you know the this approach to pull out the gene regulatory networks responsible for um pattern the patterning across you know the embryo over time um this has been like really exciting because it's pulled out certain classes uh really important um players um such as um a specific wind family members and such that have been under explored in this area of specifically um providing I don't know like dorsal ventral patterning or something like that yeah you could say something like that and now you know the the lap that i'm working with is really testing these hypotheses to see if it's true that these are really drivers of this kind of um that information in a way that we haven't been thinking about before right so that that's like the really grounded um deliverable right of like you know your method pulled this out um the lap is testing it and that should change our understanding of develop like that's what you want not like general methods for extracting things I think that that like that isn't the deliverable from the level of like the whole project right yeah that's true yeah the project will be like you said yeah it'll be essentially list of genes or list of uh gene networks that can um it's the solution is your deliverable yeah yeah yeah now the yet deliverable this is like novelty networks that actually take into account like space um or something like that um and you can give an example of this you know we pulled out like you know new winds and stuff in this um but this is just like the tip of iceberg in this problem and I've been you know I will continue working on this data because there's like a richness um to like many different aspects and you can point that out where it's like uh patterning in this or sort of localized pattern formation or something like that um just to make it clear that like this has been done right just like you've had some initial exciting data that shows that your method works oh yeah and then and then basically this will be how do other people use it right so um yeah oh how was it relevant with the department yeah we're in like the more general form of this and they're like you know what's really exciting about this is that this should you know this method while I've like you know um uh I was like that is this and uh has to this and this uh really nice sea elegance data set should apply to any data set um where we have uh multi gene date like where we have um high level gene expression data over time in a spatial manner right so you can say like you know if we um and this so this is really amenable to any sort of like um a spatial sea experiments things like that yep um in a year long time without you're like more for genetic analysis or specific collaborations with in other and again like collaboration to generalize we thought about the more what's the more for genetic analysis for what was the second part here yeah this uh the yeah right so uh the morphogenesis would be I mean it's a bit so there it's not just a spatial pattern anymore you actually have so in uh you actually have like motion on and like velocity fields and force and you know things are moving um and you have mechanical information essentially and see include that right now um in this it's purely spatial there is no mechanical uh aspect and so that we have the tracking data so to use the tracking data to actually infer these mechanical um uh uh uh sorry yeah these morphogenic processes that are happening and they come in the form of like uh um some sort of arrows uh right some sort of flow fields on the embryo geometry so even the estimating these correctly is a is a is a challenge um and and then you want to find in the same way that um we could find genes and gene legging epics that underly patented and you know find gene legging epics that underly morphogenesis and broadly essentially any brought any uh where collectives where cells are moving collectively and they're causing these um large scale uh motion patterns essentially yeah so in your eye thing that's a long term I guess that's true yeah this sort also going the long time yeah so in um i you're talking about how this is like immediately relevant for other processes and stuff and how you're excited to apply this kind of method um and you know variations of that to other types of data right yeah long permits to talk about this thing right what I would like to really do in the long term is yeah um but to gather with motion right because we know that cells are not sort of a safe way things they also move and interact which adds like this extra layer of complexity and richness um that has been very difficult to um really back to genetic um like you know who's and um their interactions so I want to do this and then you can talk about the flavors of problems where this will be important right so like this is important for like you know morphogenesis for example when in you know development cells aren't just static and you know the shape is also changing there's forces involved there's velocity of cell moving involved so if we can add these extra components we may be able to really get an understanding of what's really driving the complex gene expression patterns and then to also provide information as to which genes are potentially causing these other um uh you know um factors in the problem right like something like that and then say okay and this also directly applies to other data um such as uh you know like um you know like um like one another example that I'm like excited about is if you know what we come up with this is like you know how do tumors form um thing like that right like or how does metastasis um you know happen or something so if you can find some of these and be like you know these are problems that you can be out right where it's like oh I haven't you know I'm not an expert in this and I haven't really like thought about it in depth but um the community seem like areas where this kind of approach can also really help in our understanding of pulling out which gene regulatory networks and stuff um are responsible for these complex interventions that are happening that really define how these um biological systems change over time right right so if you could say that and that my and you know you can point out things like you might be the underlying factors is to you know wise in certain cases like you know tumors end up successfully growing and in others like these early cancerous cells potentially um don't actually become like a full um tumor and get like eradicated yeah or like the metastasis right like so if you can relate to some of those and you know you again you could just put it softly and be like no again I'm not like you know an expert but these seem like classes and problems that I would be I do you talk to people about that I think this can really help in thinking about then I think that opens up questions and stuff and yeah again you know your technical stuff so I think you know they're you're gonna hire you for that right then your ability to work with people yeah um that's where I think for the questions for the most part is like you can answer that technically and tie it back to like this is the route so always just try to do that it in like the questions when people ask you okay it's like you know how is this different from like you know PCA analysis of this right they give you a technical answer and be like and the reason why we think this that I think this is important is because this will allow us to like pull out new class new like circuits involved right like something concrete like that not like just the method itself same thing here it's like we you know this might just pull out genes that these other methods have not been able to pull out or which sets of genes are really responsible if we need to for example manipulate all of them at the same time to get this effect right like if you can point out some of these kind of things on top of your technical thing then it becomes really obvious of why it's relevant uh from uh from a biology and deliverable point of view that you're taking this so yeah just have that in mind where it's like that half of the answer they always want is your technical one the half is the rather than it's like the importance and the more you do that I think the better you'll do yeah that's I think yeah I it's somebody in my head but it's not as explicit and I think it's just should make it much more explicit it's time trying to just give this structure up when you answer questions just try like you know first time give technical and second half you just try to think about like okay like you know I answered the technical what can I say about the relevance impact the biology and if you just kind of do that it's for a few questions right where you do both parts then it's fine I I don't think you need it's like very hard in these kinds of things break from like sort of your natural uh yeah correct things so I think it better to not do that right like when you when people ask you a question you will immediately first do the technical thing that's very hard for you to stop so once you satisfy that if you can add this on top I think that should be that's a little bit more doable right there's being you know I did my initial knee jerk reaction you feel good after that too that you answered question and then just you know tell yourself oh is there just like an add-on I can do that I think you should maybe be able to formulate in that way I think it's very hard if you tell yourself you have to answer the questions starting I think this is a good way that I wasn't even thinking about it for me it was just like answer the question get under the next one but I think yeah this is this is nice now I'll constantly think about that at least I'll have that in mind that my answer isn't really over just because I've answered the technical part I have to kind of like add back and bring it back to you about all these like sort of soft points that you want to have which is like um relevance to biology and collaboration that you really care about like you know these closed loop interactions with labs right like more you can emphasize these things without them asking about it the more it shows that you're intuitively thinking about it and I think you are yeah um again they just don't come across in your answers because your focus is on like the technical right right yeah so if you could just think about all these soft things that you want to make and you can just have a list of them right hey soft things that you want to try to get across then mentally you're just kind of like ready with a couple of these like just a few of these things and then that will really I think um that that will just kind of really cover the whole yeah it exists right because the technical part is going to be very nicely I think so with the a couple of these points I think that most people will be satisfied that it seems like a team player is thinking about biology um I would be like half I would be excited to talk to him because he's into cancer um right like a couple of those people like you then that's great right that's great yeah thanks thanks a lot this has been very useful okay yeah thanks it'd be good um yeah yeah I haven't even been doing a lot of the the job talk the job talk I have something but I think this is I realize I'm very bad at this so I'm focusing a lot more on uh on this um in the job talk I have multiple versions of it prepared uh I'm given several times so except the last bit on the embryo um so that I'm having tomorrow with with hurry as well extend that to just make sure it's real clear always like question that you set out to answer how you did that and why that's novel yeah and then the deliverable in terms math plus the aid the biology yeah like just make sure that that comes across in the talk to um in structure so that yeah question why is it relevant yeah your contribution then truth biology right like what came out from using that that that didn't exist before right like we found like you know from that for like high data we found that these windings are actually really important for this kind of patterning in a way that wasn't you know thought about before and now we can go and directly test them and see what happens right like that's a very sort of um concrete sort of thing that happened because of you yeah yeah that is not like some abstract thing of like we made a model right because models are both said unless like they help in you know ending understanding of anything it's just make it really clear even if it's like a low level example of like we found a wind gene that people are like oh that was something that you know they couldn't find until like to make this model but this math from it you know I just didn't zero of the math but then it's like oh if you can come up with these methods for these problems like clearly then that will open up new avenues they think that then they'll think you're like a really good candidate yeah so yeah but yeah um yeah let me know if you have any questions or anything but yeah just rest up yes thanks yeah anything oh that help no I think yeah this is it if I know this this structure is really hope for actually because yeah before I only have the problems I'll look on more or less um but but structuring it in this way and really integrating it in terms of um what's the biology stuff to be nice yeah right right it's like you know how long do you think it'll take you to do like this first part of aim what very very right and be like you know with like and with how many people right be like oh sometimes people want to hear that like oh I think if I have one student working on you know a month together I think both of us we we can work on this in conjunction with like another lab and we can you know do this and you know we should be able to develop methods to test within like a year human hopefully I working with people will be able to you know do this I think that the second part we think that you know that's something as I like interacted with people and the um in the department and stuff I would like to tailor these to some other classes of problems and stuff and I hope again um start talking to people on that as soon as I joined but maybe in like my second and third year is really start to ramp up some of this with like a you know a student or whatever that I would hire with these kinds of skills specifically maybe that understands you know maybe for like game two like oh they understand like gain reg it you know um you know someone to buy on formatics background plus this because sometimes they might want to know like what kind of people will you try so like just be ready with some of that kind of that's to like exploit the time scales just something where you're like I have an answer not like oh I didn't actually think about yeah this I am not really thought about a little bit yeah I don't know about the other types of I think questions that people sometimes get annoying about yeah yeah okay yeah thanks a lot yeah let me know how it goes thanks yeah I will feel that yeah possibly\n"
